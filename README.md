# GTmix2
##Inference of admixture graph (AG) based on coalescent theory

GTmix2 is the more efficient version of the original GTmix program (https://github.com/yufengwudcs/GTmix).

## How to build GTmix2?

GTmix2 is simple to build. Once you download the zip file from this GitHub repository. All you need is to (i) open a terminal to go to the unzipped folder, (ii) change directory to the "src" folder and  (iii) type "make". That is,

cd src
make

The executable gtmix2 is located within the src folder.

## How to run GTmix2?

Start by test whether GTmix2 runs on your computer as follows. From the src folder, type:

./gtmix2 -n 1 -P listPops4p1a.txt test-trees.nwk

Explanation: 
"-n 1":                you want to reconstruct an AG with one admixture. 
"-P listPops4p1a.txt:  specifiy the population definiton file, which specifies which haplotype (numerically numbered by default) belongs to which population. 
"test-trees.nwk"       the file containing the genealogical trees.

If it runs, you should see:

## How does GTmix2 work?
I haven't written up the methodologies of GTmix2 yet. To get some ideas, I recommend to check out the original GTmix repository (https://github.com/yufengwudcs/GTmix). 

## How to cite this work?
For now, cite the original GTmix paper:
